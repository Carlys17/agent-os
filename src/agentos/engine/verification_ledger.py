"""Did the turn that changed code ever check that the code still works?

A turn that edits three files and then answers "done" is the most common way an
agent is confidently wrong. Nothing in the loop notices: every tool call
succeeded, the model produced text, the turn ended cleanly. The only thing
missing is the one step that would have caught the mistake.

This module keeps a passive ledger of two things per turn — which files were
mutated, and whether a verification command ran *after* the last mutation — and
answers one question at the end: is the model about to stop on unverified
edits?

It is policy only. It runs nothing, and it has no opinion on what the right
command is; it recognises that one ran. Whether the answer becomes a log line,
a warning, or a follow-up turn belongs to the runtime.

Two exclusions keep it from crying wolf, both learned the hard way in the
runtimes that shipped this before:

* **Prose is not code.** A turn that edits only Markdown, text or data files has
  nothing a test could exercise. Demanding verification for a README edit
  teaches the model to ignore the nudge.
* **Chat is not a workspace.** On a messaging surface the agent is answering a
  person, not maintaining a checkout, and there is usually no test command to
  run at all.
