"""Section outline for skill bodies too large to hand back whole.

``skill_view`` used to return every byte of a SKILL.md. That is fine for the
shipped set — 37 bundled skills, median 2.4k characters — but skills installed
from a hub or written for another agent run far larger: 56k characters for one
hub skill, 87k for one in ``~/.agents/skills``. At roughly four characters per
token that is 14k–22k tokens spent in a single tool result, paid again on every
re-read, and none of it is cached the way the system prompt is.

The fix is not to cut the text off. It is to return the opening sections whole
and hand back an index of the rest, so the agent can ask for the one section it
needs. Everything here is a pure function over the body text.
