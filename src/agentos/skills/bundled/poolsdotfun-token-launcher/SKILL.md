# pools.fun token launcher

Launches tokens through the pools.fun `PartyFactory` on Robinhood Chain
(`0x626C3d09B65bF5d1D40E0D5F25e19fa49783B3D4`), and manages creator fees on the
`PartyLocker` afterwards.

**Set this once per shell**, then every command below is copy-pasteable:

```bash
S="{baseDir}/scripts"
```

There is no RPC to configure. The chain is fixed (Robinhood Chain, 4663) and the
endpoint is built in.

**Environment.** `POOLSFUN_PRIVATE_KEY` is required to send anything; read
commands work without it if you pass `--from 0x…`. `PINATA_JWT` is **optional**
and needed only to attach a token image — set it in the agent environment (or
`~/.agentos/.env`) if you want `--image`. It is intentionally not declared as a
requirement, so the skill stays available when it is unset.

## What a launch actually does

One transaction, and all of it is irreversible:

1. CREATE2-deploys a fixed-supply ERC20 — **1,000,000,000 tokens**, no owner, no
   mint function, no transfer hooks.
2. Creates a SushiSwap V3 pool at **1% fee** and initialises it at the protocol's
   launch tick.
3. Mints the **entire supply** as one single-sided full-range position and sends
   the LP NFT **to the locker, permanently**. The launcher never holds the LP.
4. Optionally performs a **dev buy** — your own first purchase, executed as the
   pool's first swap inside the same transaction, so it cannot be front-run.

There is no launch fee. A launch costs gas (~6.1M) plus whatever you choose to
dev-buy.

## Three things you cannot choose

Say these plainly when a user asks for them, because the flags do not exist:

* **The opening price / market cap.** Every pools.fun token opens at the
  protocol's `initialFdvUsd` — currently **$10,000 FDV**. The factory reads its
  own Chainlink feed to derive the tick, and `expectedStartTick` in the ABI is a
  race guard, not an input: a mismatch reverts `StartTickChanged()`. Changing it
  requires `setInitialFdvUsd`, which is `onlyOwner` (the pools.fun team). A dev
  buy only moves the price **up**, after the open.
* **The supply, fee tier, or LP range.** All hard-coded in the factory.
* **Keeping the LP.** It goes to the locker on launch, always.

## Part A — Read (no key, no funds, nothing sent)

```bash
python3 "$S/pools_read.py" preflight              # can I launch, and at what price?
python3 "$S/pools_read.py" assets                 # the paired-asset allowlist
python3 "$S/pools_read.py" mine-salt --name "My Token" --symbol MYT --deployer 0xYou
python3 "$S/pools_read.py" simulate --name "My Token" --symbol MYT --dev-buy 0.001 --from 0xYou
python3 "$S/pools_read.py" token 0xTokenAddress   # a launched token's pool, price, LP
python3 "$S/pools_read.py" fees  0xTokenAddress   # creator fee position
python3 "$S/pools_read.py" find-image             # locate a chat-attached logo
```

Start with `preflight`. It answers the three questions that decide whether a
launch can happen at all — is the factory paused, is the price feed live, and is
Pinata configured for an image — plus the exact FDV the launch will open at.

Every read command takes `--json`. All of them work with no environment
variables set, as long as you pass `--from`/`--deployer`.

## Part B — Launch

A launch needs **a name, a symbol, and optionally an image**. Everything else is
defaulted and every default is printed in the plan, labelled `[default]`.

```bash
python3 "$S/pools_write.py" launch --name "My Token" --symbol MYT --image ./logo.png
```

That prints a plan and sends nothing. To execute, re-run with the hash it
printed:

```bash
python3 "$S/pools_write.py" launch --name "My Token" --symbol MYT --image ./logo.png \
  --broadcast --confirm 0x3f9a2c11
```

**Never invent a PLAN_HASH.** It comes from the dry run and covers every field
that determines what lands on-chain. If the price feed moved between the two
steps the hash changes and the broadcast refuses — that is the mechanism working,
not a bug. Re-read the new plan and confirm that.

### The defaults

| Setting | Default | Override |
|---|---|---|
| paired asset | WETH | `--paired usdg` |
| dev buy | **0** | `--dev-buy 0.001` (ETH) or `--dev-buy-asset 5` (paired ERC20) |
| fee recipient | you | `--fee-recipient 0x…` |
| deadline | +1200s | `--deadline-secs 600` |
| slippage | 1% | `--slippage-bps 300` |
| salt | mined for you | `--salt 0x…` |

Identity flags: `--description`, `--website`, `--twitter`, `--metadata-uri`,
`--pin-metadata`.

### Token image and metadata

Three paths, picked automatically:

1. `--metadata-uri ipfs://…` — you already host it. Never touches Pinata.
2. `--image <path>` — pins the logo and the metadata JSON to IPFS.
   **Requires `PINATA_JWT`.** `<path>` is a real file on this machine — see
   "Getting the image" below, because a chat attachment usually is not one.
3. Neither — the metadata JSON is inlined as a `data:application/json;base64,…`
   URI. **No secret, no network.** This is the default and it works everywhere.

If `--image` is passed without `PINATA_JWT` the command **fails** rather than
launching without the picture. That is deliberate: the token's identity is
immutable the moment the transaction lands, and there is no second chance to
attach a logo.

### Getting the image when the user attached it in chat

**Read this before hunting for a path.** When a user attaches an image and says
"use this as the logo", you receive the *pixels* — an image content block. You
are never told a filename or a path, and for anything under about 2 MB **no file
is written at all**: AgentOS keeps small attachments inline in the transcript.
Guessing at paths like `./logo.png` or `/tmp/image.png` will fail, and repeated
guessing is the failure mode this section exists to prevent.

Larger attachments (and everything arriving through a channel adapter) *are*
staged to disk, content-addressed and with no file extension:

```
~/.agentos/media/transcripts/<session-id>/<sha256-of-the-bytes>
```

Nothing hands you that sha, so run:

```bash
python3 "$S/pools_read.py" find-image
```

It lists staged images newest-first with type, size and full path, and prints
the exact `launch --image …` line to use. If it finds nothing, that is a real
answer — the image is not on disk — and it prints the alternatives.

**In order of preference:**

1. `find-image` returns a candidate whose type and size match what was sent →
   pass that path to `--image`.
2. Otherwise **ask the user for the file path** on their machine. In the CLI they
   can run `! ls ~/Downloads/*.png`, or drag the file into the terminal to paste
   its path. This is the reliable route and it is not a failure to ask.
3. If the logo is already hosted anywhere, skip Pinata: `--metadata-uri
   ipfs://…` or an `https://…` URL pointing at the metadata JSON.
4. Launch with no logo. The metadata still inlines and the token still launches —
   but say so explicitly first, because **a logo cannot be added afterwards**.

Never fabricate a path, and never silently launch without the image when the
user asked for one.

### Dev buys

Two funding modes, never both (the factory reverts `AmbiguousDevBuy()`):

* `--dev-buy <eth>` sends native ETH. **WETH pairs only.**
* `--dev-buy-asset <amount>` pulls the paired ERC20 and needs an allowance first:
  `python3 "$S/pools_write.py" approve --paired usdg`

The quoted fill is exact, not an estimate — the swap is the pool's first, inside
the launch transaction.

## Part C — Creator fees

The locker holds the LP forever, but trading fees accrue to you.

```bash
python3 "$S/pools_read.py"  fees 0xToken              # what is there
python3 "$S/pools_write.py" collect-and-claim 0xToken # sweep + pay out
python3 "$S/pools_write.py" set-fee-recipient 0xToken --recipient 0xNew
```

`collect` sweeps fees from the LP position into the locker; `claim` pays out your
share of what the locker holds; `collect-and-claim` does both in one transaction
and is usually what you want. Each takes the same `--broadcast --confirm` gate.

## Error handling

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `TokenNotToken0` | The salt no longer produces an address below the paired asset | Re-run without `--salt` to mine a fresh one |
| `StartTickChanged` | The ETH price feed updated between planning and sending | Re-run; confirm the new hash |
| `DeployFailed` | A token already exists at that salt's address | Change name/symbol/metadata, or use a different `--salt` |
| `CreatorNotCaller` | `creator` must equal the sending wallet | Drop `--fee-recipient` confusion; creator is always the signer |
| `AmbiguousDevBuy` | Both `--dev-buy` and `--dev-buy-asset` given | Pick one |
| `DevBuyWethOnly` | Native ETH dev buy on a USDG pair | Use `--dev-buy-asset` after `approve` |
| `DevBuyTooLittle` | Fill came in under the slippage floor | Raise `--slippage-bps` |
| `PairedAssetNotAllowed` | Asset is not on the allowlist | `pools_read.py assets` |
| `Paused` | The factory is paused | Wait; nothing else to do |
| `--broadcast needs --confirm` | Dry run not confirmed | Re-run with the printed hash |
| `plan changed since it was printed` | Feed moved, or a flag differs from the dry run | Re-read the plan, confirm the new hash |
| `PINATA_JWT is not set` | `--image` without Pinata | Set it, or drop `--image` |
| `image not found: …` | Guessed a path for a chat attachment | Run `find-image`; if empty, ask the user for the real path |
| `no qualifying salt in N attempts` | Unlucky search | Raise `--max-salt-attempts` |
| `env var POOLSFUN_PRIVATE_KEY is not set` | No signing key | Set it, or pass `--from 0x…` to plan only |

Set `POOLSFUN_DEBUG=1` for full tracebacks.

## Why the salt has to be mined

The factory mints single-sided liquidity and requires the launched token to be
`token0` of the pair, so the CREATE2 address must sort numerically **below** the
paired asset or `launch` reverts `TokenNotToken0()`. Against WETH
(`0x0Bd7…`) about **4.6%** of salts qualify, so the skill searches — batched
`computeTokenAddress` calls, usually resolved in one round trip.

A salt is bound to the exact `(deployer, name, symbol, metadataUri)`. Change any
of them and it must be re-mined. This is why `--metadata-uri` is resolved
*before* mining, not after.

## Verifying a change

```bash
python3 "$S/selftest.py"          # offline, no network, no key
python3 "$S/pools_read.py" preflight
python3 "$S/pools_write.py" launch --name "Test" --symbol TST   # plan only
```

The selftest pins the launch calldata against the real reference transaction
(`0x0978ee72…`), so an encoding regression fails there rather than on-chain.

See `assets/partyfactory-reference.md` for the full ABI, the decoded reference
launch, and the locker's fee-split mechanics.
